# Proxmox UnPrivileged Manager

`pupman` is a lightweight CLI tool for managing UID/GID mappings for unprivileged LXC containers. It provides a clean interface to allocate and validate ID ranges defined in `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`, and ensures consistency and isolation in your container configurations.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Scan and validate UID/GID ranges for conflicts and overlaps
- 🔐 Helps enforce user namespace isolation and prevent security issues
- 🛠️ Ideal for homelabs, Proxmox setups, and manual LXC deployments
<!--
- 🧩 **Generate** valid `lxc.idmap` entries for unprivileged containers
- 📂 **Sync** container configs with system-wide subuid/subgid assignments
-->

## 📦 Installation

## 🔍 Why This Matters

Unprivileged LXC containers rely on UID/GID mapping to isolate the container's root user from the host. Mismanaged or overlapping mappings can:

- Break container startup
- Lead to privilege escalation risks
- Create hard-to-debug permission issues

`lxcidman` takes the guesswork out of ID management by giving you a clear view of how your subuid/subgid space is used—and helps you avoid stepping on yourself.
